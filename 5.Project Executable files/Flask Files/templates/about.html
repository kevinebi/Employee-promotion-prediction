        <p>An employee promotion is when an employee is given a higher position within an organization, which can include more responsibilities, authority, and possibly a higher salary or benefits package. Promotions can be based on merit, performance, skills, experience, and potential. They can occur at the same job level, or they can involve moving to a higher job level. Promotions can be a crucial juncture in an employee's professional journey and can make them feel valued and motivated. They can also increase an employee's loyalty to the business and lead to increased productivity.</p>
